# IQR vs Standard Deviation

## Why is 1.5 used in IQR Analysis for finding out outliers ?
- In descriptive statistics, the interquartile range is a measure of statistical dispersion, which is the spread of the data. The IQR may also be called the midspread, middle 50%, fourth spread, or Hâ€‘spread. It is defined as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the data. 
-  A Z-score is a numerical measurement that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. Z-score is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point's score is identical to the mean score.
- We use the above 2 concepts and find out why 1.5 is used for finding the lower and upper limits when looking for outliers
